    "text": "Libya has been facing severe urban flooding in recent years caused by climate change and political instability. This led to life threatening consequences of death and destruction in the country. For instance, the collapse of the Derna dam in 2023 caused thousands of deaths and irreversible damage to the infrastructures. This devastated the country socially and economically. As a result, the government decided to deploy some measures to prepare for future disasters and assist in recovery and relief.\nThrough this project, we aim to enhance Derna City’s preparedness and reducing its rescue time. This is done by mapping out the accessibility of residential areas to emergency centres and medical services. We hope to provide meaningful insights for minimising the impact of flood disasters on Derna City and propose recommendations for future disaster management planning."

    "text": "Project Objectives\nOur objective is to analyse the accessibility of residential towns to emergency evacuation centres and medical services in the event of a future flood. Additionally, we aim to suggest potential sites that can be used as an emergency centre.\nWe plan to conduct this by comparing the locations of emergency and medical centres and their accessibility to residential which are densely populated, and analysing whether there is a sufficient number of emergency and medical centres in Derna city. \nOur 2 research questions are as follows:\n\nAre there enough emergency and medical centres in the area to meet demands in Derna city?\nWhich areas have less emergency and medical centres and are less accessible which may potentially affect the efficiency of disaster relief?"

Yet, insufficient measures are put in placed by the government to prevent it from occurring again.\nThis project aims to find out the accessibility of emergency and medical centres to people in order to improve Derna city’s level of preparedness and reduce rescue time. This is done by evaluating whether there are enough emergency facilities in populated areas and whether they are easily accessible."
